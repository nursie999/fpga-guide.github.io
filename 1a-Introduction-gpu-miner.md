  This section is a work in progress, but it's worth noting the upcoming Acorn FPGA.

Hey there, we're in the same boat, just a few months ago we invested a considerable amount into both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, specifically NVidia 1080 Tis and AMD Vega 64s.

With FPGA's scheduled to flood the mining ecosystem in August / September, we have only a little time to make preparations.

GPUHoarder from Squirrel Research is creating a small FPGA chip that helps GPUs use their resources more efficiently, resulting in accelerated hash rates for certain algorithms.  Only a few algorithms and GPUs will be supported at launch though.

We bought a few and will be publishing results and how-to guides.  For more info drop by telegram.
