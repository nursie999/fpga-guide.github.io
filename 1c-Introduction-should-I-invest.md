Ah a timeless Question!  

Honestly it depends entirely on your risk tolerance.  This is risky for sure, you're putting a lot of faith into a small handful of dev's hands, and a market that's about as frothy as my cappuccino.

I can't tell you if you should or should not invest, but IF you decide to purchase an FPGA, we're here to help you get set up.  

By creating fpga.guide, we're aiming to **make FPGA mining easy to understand** and more accessible to miners.
