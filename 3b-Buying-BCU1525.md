<p class="message" style="color:red;">The BCU1525 sold by SQRL and allmine.co is now sold out with no announced next batch.</p>

The BCU 1525 is SQRL and allmine's modified VCU 1525 for cryptocurrency mining.  Some units were sold with mining modifications and an encryption key burned into the efuse, others were sold without the mods.  The efuse gives miners access to proprietary bitstreams powered by the Allmine Crypto Shell well as public bitstreams provided by the community.
