Like a lot of my fellow miners out there, we come from a **GPU** mining world where **AMD** and **NVIDIA** battle for hashrates.  As a GPU miner myself, I was both curious and concerned, and after weeks of research and testing FPGAs, we've compiled this guide to help the community ramp up.

FPGAs are about to make a big splash in mining, the initial results are extremely promising and thereâ€™s little denying it. See for yourself.

# Stay Informed!

There's a lot of chatter, a lot of noise, and a lot of scams!  **I highly recommend subscribing to our updates**.  A lot is happening very quickly, there are 7+ companies, 50+ FPGA developers, 3+ FPGA devices, and many algorithms.  

**very hard to keep track of it all**

Luckily fpga.guide will be monitoring all important developments from the FPGA community, including 

* miner downloads 
* FPGA sales
* verified hashrates
* new releases
* and much more

# Why this guide?

---

This guide is here to help prepare the mining community.  We'll cover everything you need to know.  The FPGA and GPU mining worlds are similar, but also have profound differences.  There is however little doubt that things are shifting ... *and quickly*.

There are a lot of details in this guide, but if you want to get your hands dirty right away, check out our [step by step guide using FPGAs on AWS](/4a-Howto-AWS).  At the end that guide, you'll be mining Tribus with 1 FPGA card at **10x the speed of a GTX-1080TI**

**Probably best to see the results for yourself ...**
