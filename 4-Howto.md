The tech stack for FPGA programming is totally different from our GPU world.  

Tutorials are a great way to learn new tools and technologies.  We'll be adding detailed How-To guides here with step by step instructons to make things as simple as possible, and hopefully can help the community get up to speed!  As we run our own experiments, we'll be documenting and sharing our learnings here.

# AWS F1 instances with VCU 1525 FPGAs.  

Since we don't have our BCU 1525 yet, we've started learning and experimenting with Amazon's F1 instances.  These are cloud instances you can rent form amazon for an hourly price, it's a great way to get started with synthesizing some of the public FPGA miner designs available, and to learn about the technology behind it all.  

Check out [Tribus on AWS](/4a-Howto-AWS) to spin up a singple VCU 1525 on AWS and run a Tribus miner at 600 MH/s, which is 10x the speed of the powerful NVidia 1080 Ti.

We'll be adding more guides in the upcoming weeks.  Drop us your email to get notified!
